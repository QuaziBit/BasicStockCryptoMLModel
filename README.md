# Machine Learning Stock and Cryptocurrency Analysis Script

## Script Overview

This script is a powerful, configurable framework designed to analyze stock and cryptocurrency data using modern machine learning techniques. It provides the following features:

## Key Features:

### Data Handling and Preprocessing:
- Supports both stock and cryptocurrency datasets.
- Handles missing values, resamples data to different timeframes, and computes technical indicators such as MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Stochastic Oscillators.
- Incorporates crypto-specific constraints like market capitalization for validation.

### Model Building and Training:
- Offers flexibility to configure model architectures, including time-step settings, dropout rates, hidden layer sizes, and future prediction steps.
- Includes support for attention layers and raw feature extraction for more nuanced learning.

### Prediction and Validation:
- Generates price predictions for stocks and cryptocurrencies.
- Validates cryptocurrency predictions to ensure alignment with realistic market behavior, such as limiting price fluctuations to a maximum percentage change.

### Evaluation and Metrics:
- Computes evaluation metrics like MAE, RMSE, RÂ², and directional accuracy.
- Logs detailed metrics for training and testing performance.

### Interactive Visualizations:
- Provides rich, interactive visualizations using Plotly, including:
  - Residual analysis with time-series and distribution plots.
  - Advanced indicators like MACD, volume correlation, and stochastic oscillators.
  - Detailed dashboards for price prediction analysis.
  - Crypto-specific visualizations incorporating market capitalization trends.

### Custom Configuration Options:
- Allows users to create new models or load existing ones.
- Offers customization of train-test splits, learning rates, epochs, batch sizes, and more.
- Built with reproducibility in mind, enabling global random seed settings.

### Future Predictions:
- Predicts future price trends for configurable time steps with advanced plotting of error bands and detailed analysis.

### Feature Development:
- **Docker Support**: Future plans include providing a Docker setup to simplify environment configuration and deployment.
- **Web Interface**: Plans to integrate a web-based UI for easier interaction, visualization, and analysis.

### Data Directory Structure:
- Stock data is expected in the directory: `/data/stocks/<stock_name>/<file_name>.csv`
- Cryptocurrency data is expected in the directory: `/data/crypto/<crypto_name>/<file_name>.csv`

### Data:
- Stock CSV File: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- You can run ```get_yfinance_data_v7.py``` if you need Stock data.
- Cryptocurrency CSV File: [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)
- Current I do not have a script to grab Crypto data

### Required File Formats:
- **Stock CSV File**:
  ```
  Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Adj Close,Volume
  ```
- **Cryptocurrency CSV File**:
  ```
  timeOpen;timeClose;timeHigh;timeLow;name;open;high;low;close;volume;marketCap;timestamp
  ```

## How to Run the Script

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.10.5.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Script
To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python .\lstm_ai_v24_7_daily_b.py
```

### Output Directory
- The script automatically generates an output directory in the same location as the script. 
- This directory contains:
  - **Visualizations**: Interactive plots in HTML format.
  - **Logs**: Detailed training, evaluation, and prediction logs.
  - **Saved Models**: Serialized model files for future use.
  - **Metrics Reports**: CSV files summarizing performance metrics.

Ensure that the script has appropriate permissions to create directories and write files in its directory.
