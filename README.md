# Machine Learning Stock and Cryptocurrency Analysis Script

## Script Overview

This script is a powerful, configurable framework designed to analyze stock and cryptocurrency data using modern machine learning techniques. It provides the following features:

## Key Features:

### Data Handling and Preprocessing:
- Supports both stock and cryptocurrency datasets.
- Handles missing values, resamples data to different timeframes, and computes technical indicators such as MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Stochastic Oscillators.
- Incorporates crypto-specific constraints like market capitalization for validation.

### Model Building and Training:
- Offers flexibility to configure model architectures, including time-step settings, dropout rates, hidden layer sizes, and future prediction steps.
- Includes support for attention layers and raw feature extraction for more nuanced learning.

### Prediction and Validation:
- Generates price predictions for stocks and cryptocurrencies.
- Validates cryptocurrency predictions to ensure alignment with realistic market behavior, such as limiting price fluctuations to a maximum percentage change.

### Evaluation and Metrics:
- Computes evaluation metrics like MAE, RMSE, RÂ², and directional accuracy.
- Logs detailed metrics for training and testing performance.

### Interactive Visualizations:
- Provides rich, interactive visualizations using Plotly, including:
  - Residual analysis with time-series and distribution plots.
  - Advanced indicators like MACD, volume correlation, and stochastic oscillators.
  - Detailed dashboards for price prediction analysis.
  - Crypto-specific visualizations incorporating market capitalization trends.

### Custom Configuration Options:
- Allows users to create new models or load existing ones.
- Offers customization of train-test splits, learning rates, epochs, batch sizes, and more.
- Built with reproducibility in mind, enabling global random seed settings.

### Future Predictions:
- Predicts future price trends for configurable time steps with advanced plotting of error bands and detailed analysis.


# Docker Setup and Usage for Machine Learning Stock and Cryptocurrency Analysis Script

## Docker Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).

### Build the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and run:

```bash
# Rebuild the Docker Image
$ docker build -t lstm-crypt-stocks .
```

### Running the Docker Container

#### 1. Default Output to Current Directory
To run the Docker container and save the output to the same folder where the Docker script is being executed:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
$ docker run -it --name lstm-container -v ${PWD}:/host/root lstm-crypt-stocks lstm
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
$ docker run -it --name lstm-container -v $(pwd):/host/root lstm-crypt-stocks lstm
```

#### 2. Save Output to Desktop
If you want to save the output to the Desktop:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
$ docker run -it --name lstm-container -v C:\Users\<username>\Desktop:/host/desktop lstm-crypt-stocks lstm
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
$ docker run -it --name lstm-container -v ~/Desktop:/host/desktop lstm-crypt-stocks lstm
```

### Reusing the Docker Container
Instead of creating a new container each time, you can reuse an existing container:

```bash
# Restart and attach to the existing container
$ docker start -ai lstm-container
```

### Removing the Docker Container
If you need to remove the container:

#### 1. List All Containers
```bash
$ docker ps -a
```

#### 2. Remove a Specific Container by Name
```bash
$ docker rm lstm-container
```

#### 3. Remove All Stopped Containers (Optional)
```bash
$ docker container prune -f
```

### Data Directory Structure:
- Stock data is expected in the directory: `/data/stocks/<stock_name>/<file_name>.csv`
- Cryptocurrency data is expected in the directory: `/data/crypto/<crypto_name>/<file_name>.csv`

### Data:
- Stock CSV File: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- Cryptocurrency CSV File: [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

### Required File Formats:
- **Stock CSV File**:
  ```
  Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Adj Close,Volume
  ```
- **Cryptocurrency CSV File**:
  ```
  timeOpen;timeClose;timeHigh;timeLow;name;open;high;low;close;volume;marketCap;timestamp
  ```

## How to Run the Script - you don't need Docker

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.10.5.
2. Init venv: ```py -3 -m venv project_name``` or ```py -3.x -m venv project_name```
3. Navigate to your folder Scripts and type in the terminal:
   1. .\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   2. or ```deactivate``` if you wanna stop venv
   3. If cannot run from PowerShell
      1. ```Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass;``` 
      2. ```.\Scripts\Activate.ps1```
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Script
To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python .\lstm_ai_v24_7_daily_b.py
```

### Output Directory
- The script automatically generates an output directory in the same location as the script. 
- This directory contains:
  - **Visualizations**: Interactive plots in HTML format.
  - **Logs**: Detailed training, evaluation, and prediction logs.
  - **Saved Models**: Serialized model files for future use.
  - **Metrics Reports**: CSV files summarizing performance metrics.

Ensure that the script has appropriate permissions to create directories and write files in its directory.

### Important Notes
- **Default Output Location:** By default, the script saves outputs in the root directory where the Docker container is run.
- **Persisting Data:** Reuse the Docker container (`docker start -ai lstm-container`) to retain models and data generated in `/app/LSTM/v24_b/lstm_ai_v24_7_daily_b`.
- **Updating Data:** To update cryptocurrency or stock data, rebuild the Docker image with the latest data or remove and rebuild the container to create a fresh instance.
